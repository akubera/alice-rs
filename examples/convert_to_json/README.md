# Convert some data to json

This example demonstrates how to convert a small subset of the open data to json.
This might be useful as a quick and dirty way to analyze some data in a python or some other language.
The file `./analyze.py` shows how to access the data in the json files in python.

To create the json data file you need:

	1. [Install Rust](www.rustup.rs)
	2. Download some files using `alice-download` from this repository
	3. Run this example with `cargo run --release`
